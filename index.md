I'm a postdoctoral researcher with Professor [Bill Dietrich](http://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/william-e-dietrich) at UC Berkeley's [Eel River Critical Zone Observatory](http://criticalzone.org/eel/). My research aims to improve understanding of how Earth’s porous, near surface layer – the critical zone – governs the ecohydrology of seasonally dry landscapes.

I'm ferrying material from my old website to GitHub pages, and hope to have some research and teaching highlights here before too long. Till then, here I am ferrying Jesse across Dry Creek.
