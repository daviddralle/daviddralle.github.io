I'm a postdoctoral researcher with Professor [Bill Dietrich](http://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/william-e-dietrich) at UC Berkeley's [Eel River Critical Zone Observatory](http://criticalzone.org/eel/). My research aims to improve understanding of how Earth’s porous, near surface layer – the critical zone – governs the ecohydrology of seasonally dry landscapes.
